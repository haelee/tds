## Transition Map
- 1st unit: state from
- 2nd unit: state to

## Instruction Format
- 1st unit: Instruction
- 2nd unit: OP1 (1st operand)
- 3rd unit: OP2 (2nd operand)

## Instructions
- TDSI_UC: Transition upon any event occurs.
- TDSI_EQ: Transition if the given value equal to OP1.

## To be implemented
- TDSI_ST1: smaller than operand 1
- TDSI_SE1: smaller than or equal to operand 1
- TDSI_LE1: larger than or equal to operand 1
- TDSI_LT1: larger than operand 1
- TDSI_ST2: smaller than operand 2
- TDSI_SE2: smaller than or equal to operand 2
- TDSI_LE2: larger than or equal to operand 2
- TDSI_LT2: larger than operand 2
